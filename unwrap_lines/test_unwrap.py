            Multiple assignment (also known as tuple unpacking or iterable
            unpacking) allows you to assign multiple variables at the same
            time in one line of code. This feature often seems simple after
            you've learned about it, but **it can be tricky to recall
            multiple assignment when you need it most**.

            In this article we'll see what multiple assignment is, we'll take
            a look at common uses of multiple assignment, and then we'll look
            at a few uses for multiple assignment that are often overlooked.

            Note that in this article I will be using [f-strings][] which are
            a Python 3.6+ feature. If you're on an older version of Python,
            you'll need to mentally translate those to use the string
            `format` method.
